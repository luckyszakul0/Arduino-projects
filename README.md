### Arduino projects

This repository is for small projects and other ideas I want to create while I'm in the process of learning the basics of Arduino and electronics as a whole. Each project directory contains the files with the .ino files having the main code. They also contain circuit image and component list if someone wants to reproduce the result that I've gotten.

**Project list:**
- Morse code encoder
